# Epilogue

If there are parts that you feel could have been described better, let us know in the [live chat](https://gitter.im/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  This entire book was built using Git, so you can see the process by which it was created on [its GitHub page](https://github.com/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  Because it is licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), you are free to make and distribute your own changes.

There are a few places where we have departed from vanilla git in a significant way.  We are not rebels without cause, our [cause is right here](departures/departures.md).
