This repo contains the source for a [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) which describes how to learn git from scratch.

* You can read this book at [gitfromscratch.com](http://www.gitfromscratch.com)
* You can subscribe to changes in this book at [gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/book/diffplug/gitfromscratch/details)

## To edit this book locally

`gradlew buildDocs` will build it and `gradlew serveDocs` will serve it.

The production version on `gitfromscratch.com` is built by gitbooks' infrastructure, which uses the latest version.  The local build is stuck on 1.3.2, as shown in `package.json`.  Only known issue is that the local build uses README.md as the intro instead of INTRO.md.
