# I did some work. How do I share it?

Git is a powerful way to track the history of your files, but it's an even more powerful way to share and collaborate on files.

In this section, we'll show you how to share commits with other repositories. First, we'll show you how to [establish a connection](remotes/remotes.md) with a remote repository, and download everything it has to offer. Next we'll show you how to [collaborate on a fixed target (tags)](tags/tags.md) and then on a [moving target (branches)](branches/branches.md).

After playing around with sharing, you're going to quickly encounter the situation where you've done some work, but someone else has published a new version in the meantime. This sets you up perfectly for the next section, where we'll show you how you can [move your work](../time-travel/time-travel.md) onto the latest version.

So, without further ado, let's [establish a connection](remotes/remotes.md).
