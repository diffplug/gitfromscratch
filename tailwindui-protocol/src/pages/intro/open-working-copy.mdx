*NOTE: Rather than dragging a file from your file explorer, you can use any of the methods described in the [DiffPlug quickstart](https://docs.diffplug.com/2.0.2/getting-started/quickstart/) to get the context-menu for a file.*

Next, [take a look at how DiffPlug handles commits](../commit/commit.md).
