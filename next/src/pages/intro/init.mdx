# Init a new repository

To take a folder and start tracking its changes, just right-click it and then `Git -> Create new`.

*Hint 1: You can't put a git repository inside another repository.  If you don't see `Create new` as an option, you're probably inside an existing repository, and you need to move up to a higher folder.*

*Hint 2: Rather than using the text bar at the top of the window, you can use any of the methods described in the [DiffPlug quickstart](https://docs.diffplug.com/2.0.2/getting-started/quickstart/) to get the context-menu for a file.*

Now that you've got an empty repository, you can start [making commits](/intro/commit).
