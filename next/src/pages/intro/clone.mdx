# Clone an existing repository

Copying a repository from someone else's computer onto yours is called "cloning".  There are two things you're going to need:

1. The URL you want to clone from
	+ This acts like the "phone number" which git will call to ask for the latest version.
	+ Later on, we'll show you how to upload changes you make to this URL.
	+ If you want a toy project, these are some good ones:
		+ [`https://github.com/nasa/T-MATS`](https://github.com/nasa/T-MATS) is a great Simulink example
		+ [`https://github.com/diffplug/gitfromscratch`](https://github.com/diffplug/gitfromscratch) is the source to this guide
2. The folder on your computer where you're going to put the clone

Go to wherever you'd like to put your clone, right-click it and then `Git -> Clone`.  This will open a dialog where you can put the URL, and pick a destination folder on your computer.  Once the download completes, you'll have your shiny new clone.

*Hint 1: You can't put a git repository inside another repository.  If you don't see `Clone` as an option, you're probably inside an existing repository, and you need to move up to a higher folder.*

*Hint 2: Rather than using the text bar at the top of the window, you can use any of the methods described in the [DiffPlug quickstart](https://docs.diffplug.com/2.0.2/getting-started/quickstart/) to get the context-menu for a file.*
