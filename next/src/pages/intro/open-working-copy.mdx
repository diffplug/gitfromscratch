To open an existing working copy, drag the folder from your file explorer onto DiffPlug's <Inline src="intro/diff-list-icon.png" alt="DiffPlug icon" /> icon. Then right-click it and select `Git -> History`.

_NOTE: Rather than dragging a file from your file explorer, you can use any of the methods described in the [DiffPlug quickstart](https://docs.diffplug.com/2.0.2/getting-started/quickstart/) to get the context-menu for a file._

Next, [take a look at how DiffPlug handles commits](/intro/commit).
