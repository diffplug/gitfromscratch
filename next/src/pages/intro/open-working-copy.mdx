# Open an existing working copy

To open an existing working copy, drag the folder from your file explorer onto DiffPlug's <Image src="diff-list-icon.png" alt="DiffPlug icon" className="inline" /> icon.  Then right-click it and select `Git -> History`.

*NOTE: Rather than dragging a file from your file explorer, you can use any of the methods described in the [DiffPlug quickstart](https://docs.diffplug.com/2.0.2/getting-started/quickstart/) to get the context-menu for a file.*

Next, [take a look at how DiffPlug handles commits](/intro/commit).
